# Platform Utils

## Get started
Copy `.env-eample` to `.env` and run tests with `npm test`.

## How to use
Install as a github npm module, and import like so:
```
// For all initializers to be run...
require('platform-utils/initializers');
const { logger } = require('platform-utils/initializers/logger');

// For a particular initializer without running them all
const joi = require('platform-utils/initializers/joi');

const joiUtils = require('platform-utils/joi');
const mongooseUtils = require('platform-utils/mongoose');
const rosieUtils = require('platform-utils/rosie');
```
Note that each kind of utility file is a separate sub-directory of the platform-utils package.

## How to Maintain
Our systems should **always** reference the package by a particular release tag so we can manage versions appropriately:
```
// In package.json dependencies...
"platform-utils": "git://github.com/greenchef/platform-utils.git#1.3.2",
```

When making changes, recognize that you are changing a package that is used across all of our services.
Make a release tag that follows [semver standards](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).

**Semver is extremely important, so PLEASE learn it and use it correctly or our services will break.**

## Expected ENV VARS in platforms that use this package:
```
LOG_LEVEL
LOGGER_NAME

MONGODB_URI
MONGODB_NAME
MONGODB_OPTIONS
OR
MONGO_URI
```
